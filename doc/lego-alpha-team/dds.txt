LEGO Alpha Team audio format (.dds)

Mono 44.1kHz Signed 16-bit PCM audio.

Using Audacity:
File -> Import -> Raw Audio

Encoding: "Signed 16 bit PCM"
Byte order: "Little-endian"
Channels: "1 Channel (Mono)"
Start offset: 0
Amount to import: 100
Sample rate: 44100

From there you can save out to wav, flac, mp3, and whatever else Audacity
supports exporting to.

At some point I may write a batch script or python script to batch convert.
